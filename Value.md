- Su: Axle’s recent customer satisfaction surveys consistently revealed low ratings for car cleanliness. This hampered our customers’ travel experience and was a contributing factor for low repeat bookings.   

- Henri: Axle Car Hire made the decision to outsource the cleaning of all vehicles to a service provider. Previously, cleaning of our vehicle fleet was performed by an internal department. The cost and effort to maintain equipment, update rosters, and manage an inflexible workforce were unsustainable. 

    - `It is important to understand that the risk of outsourcing any task or service is that an organization loses skills and capabilities. However, car cleaning is a service requiring specialized equipment as well as a flexible and motivated workforce. Continual investment in this service is something that is not beneficial for Axle.`

    - `At face value, outsourcing may appear to cost an organization more than using internal resources. Initially this may be true; however, over time and correctly managed, outsourcing services should be beneficial to both the organization and supplier. The benefit for Axle is that we can concentrate on our core business. After all, we’re not a cleaning company.   ` 

- Marco: There are always pros and cons to outsourcing. Let’s have a look at the outcomes, costs, and risks that are introduced and removed.

- Su: By partnering with a specialist cleaning organization, Axle can focus its resources on providing a better service for our users. It will also help to optimize our costs, increasing value for the organization.

`Craig is the owner of Craig’s Cleaning. Craig is methodical, reliable, and well respected by his staff. With his team, Craig is keen to contribute to the Axle vision of offering a high-standard travel experience.`

- Craig: Axle Car Hire decided to outsource its car cleaning service, and Craig’s Cleaning was chosen to take this on. My organization is now responsible for the cleanliness of the entire Axle vehicle fleet.

- Henri: The service Craig’s Cleaning is providing is only one component of the Axle customer experience. Clean cars are one output of our overall service, and they contribute directly to the customers’ travel experience. This helps Axle’s clients to achieve their outcomes.

- Su: Craig’s Cleaning is doing a great job! The cars have never been cleaner, and our customer satisfaction ratings for car cleanliness are steadily on the increase.

`Axle and Craig’s Cleaning have worked on a cleaning schedule together, with focus on car cleaning turnaround times during peak hours. Axle is responsible for providing Craig and his team with timely notice of any changes that can impact this schedule. For example, Axle may need to expand its cleaning requirements in the light of new service offerings, such as the one Marco is developing.`

- Marco: Axle has a goal to become a greener company and help the environment. We would like Craig’s Cleaning to support us in this goal and aim for the same sustainable growth as us.
